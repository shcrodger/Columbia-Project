This is the repository for the work I did during my Summer course in C at Columbia

UPDATES:

21 July #1: I have uploaded most of Lab 1. Lab 1 Ex 6 and 7 I have not completed yet as I struggled with the getting the time in a   usable variable. I will try to finish them over the weekend.
I have uploaded the Lab 2 Ex 1 and Lab 2 Ex 2a. I have not yet finished the other parts of lab 2. I will spend some time on them during the weekend.
